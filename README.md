By using this plugin, you acknowledge that blog content and comments will be processed by external AI services.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files
2. Upload the `filtah` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Configure your AI provider and API key in Settings ‚Üí Filtah

## Configuration

### 1. AI Provider Setup

Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Filtah** in your WordPress admin panel:

1. Choose AI Provider: Select between OpenAI or Groq
2. Enter API Key: 
   - For OpenAI: Get your key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - For Groq: Get your key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
3. Select Model: Choose from available models based on your provider
4. Set Default Status: Choose whether AI replies should be approved or require moderation

### 2. Available Models

#### OpenAI Models:
- GPT-3.5 Turbo (Default)
- GPT-4
- GPT-4 Turbo

#### Groq Models:
- Llama 3.3 70B (Default)
- Llama 3.1 70B
- Mixtral 8x7B

## Usage

### Automatic Replies
Once configured, Filtah will automatically generate replies to new comments on your blog posts.

### Manual Bulk Processing
Use the "Generate" button in the settings to create replies for all existing comments that haven't been replied to yet.

### Comment Management
- AI-generated replies are clearly marked in your WordPress admin
- You can edit, delete, or moderate AI replies just like regular comments
- The plugin tracks which comments have been replied to prevent duplicates

## Advanced Features

### Rate Limiting
Filtah includes built-in rate limiting (2 seconds between requests) to:
- Prevent API abuse
- Respect provider limits
- Avoid overwhelming your server

### Content Optimization
- Blog posts are trimmed to 2000 characters
- Comments are trimmed to 500 characters
- This helps control API costs while maintaining context

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error logging when `WP_DEBUG` is enabled:
- API errors
- Network issues
- Rate limiting events
- Invalid responses

## Internationalization

Filtah is ready for translation and includes:
- POT file for translators
- Text domain: `filtah`

To translate:
1. Use the included `filtah.pot` file
2. Create translations in the `languages/` directory
3. Follow WordPress i18n standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI replies not generating:**
- Check your API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits
- Verify rate limiting isn't blocking requests
- Check WordPress error logs

**Bulk generation stops:**
- Large sites may hit rate limits
- Check your hosting provider's timeout settings
- Process comments in smaller batches

**Formatting issues:**
- Groq responses are automatically parsed from markdown
- OpenAI uses direct JSON formatting
- Both are handled transparently

### Debug Mode

Enable WordPress debug mode to see detailed error logs:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for Filtah-specific errors.
